# The wire hunt: what the Checklist still needs, and where it might be

A worklist, not a reference. Every Checklist row that shows no value is here with the fields that could carry it, what the account read at the time, and how confident the match is. A row leaves when it is CONFIRMED and the code reads it; a suspect leaves when a capture rules it out.

`docs/wire_hunt.tsv` is what is still OPEN and `docs/wire_hunt_added.tsv` is what the program already reads — a row moves across when the code acts on it. Both are **hand-maintained** -- no script rewrites it, so an edit cannot be lost to a regeneration. This file says how to read it.

Columns: `Row`, `What we need`, `Read on <date>`, `Suspect`, `Confidence`, `Evidence / what would settle it`. The third holds what the account actually showed when the note was taken, which is what a later capture is diffed against.

## How a field gets confirmed

Two ways, and only these two count:

1. **A stated value matches**, and the number is distinctive enough that a coincidence is not credible — `week_total_score` reading 1396064 against a Great Rift screen showing 1396064.
2. **An action moves it**, captured before and after — buying two B-Grade Policy Reports moved `town_shop_goods_006.total_count` from 92 to 94.

Everything else is a suspect. A field whose value happens to equal a small number the screen also showed (`1`, `5`, `100`) is a suspect however well it fits.

## The confidence column

| Value | Means |
| ----- | ----- |
| `confirmed` | matched by one of the two routes above, and the evidence is in the Evidence column |
| `strong` | the name and the shape both fit and one value matched, but the value was not distinctive |
| `weak` | the name fits and nothing has been checked |
| `ruled out` | a capture disagreed. Kept, so it is not re-suggested |

## Reading the shop rows

Settled — `Vribbels/shop_stock.py` is the canonical write-up and the code that acts on it. In short: `count` is how many were bought in the CURRENT period, `total_count` is the lifetime tally, `reset_time` is when `count` last moved, and `count` is reset **lazily** so a row untouched since the period rolled still carries the previous period's number.

Which prefix is which shop, all established by buying one and reading the product id off the request:

| Prefix | Shop |
| ------ | ---- |
| `town_shop_goods_*` | Nono's Shop |
| `gacha_duplicate_legend_*` | Memory Archive — Traveler |
| `hyperspace_*` | Zeronium Shop — **not** the Basin, which is `hyperspace_entities` |
| `chaos_*` | Blackhorn Trade |
| `card_factor_*` | Exchange Shop — Prism Module |
| `season_pass_*` | Seasonal Shop |

## Identifying a mission or a shop product

**`mission_condition` is the fast route.** Any reply to an action that progressed a mission carries it, naming every mission touched, grouped by kind (`season_pass_mission`, `daily_achievement`, `achievement`, `accumulate_condition`, `disaster_achievement`) and each with a `condition_type` — `CAFE_DRINK`, `VISIT`, `DAILY_LOGIN`, `CLEAR_INGAME_CONTENTS__ID`. One action names its own missions, so a single deliberate action identifies them without a diff.

For a shop, buy one: the request carries `product_id` and the reply carries `dec_result` (what it cost) and `add_result` (what it gave), so one purchase names the product, its price and its item at once.

## What the shop rows show meanwhile

The Checklist draws `<left to buy>/<per-period max>` from `shop_stock.PRODUCTS`, a HAND-WRITTEN table, and `-` for any product not in it. **The per-period MAX is nowhere on the wire** — only `count` is — so every maximum has to be read off the game's own screen and typed in. **A product with no row in that table gets no row on the tab**, so what is missing stays visible.

## What is still missing entirely

**Nothing carries a shop product's NAME or its per-period MAX.** Both are hand-typed into `shop_stock.PRODUCTS`; `shop_res_data` carries prices and product ids but neither of those.

**Nothing carries a shop's PERIOD** either. Weekly, monthly and never-resetting are hand-marked in the same table.
