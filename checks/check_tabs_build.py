"""Every tab must survive being built.

`compileall` proves a file parses. Importing it proves its module body
runs. NEITHER touches the inside of `setup_ui`, where the widgets are
actually made -- so a name that went missing there is invisible to both
and surfaces as a traceback on the next launch, with the window never
appearing.

This builds each tab against a withdrawn Tk root and a real AppContext.
It catches the whole class: undefined names, wrong widget options, a
constant deleted from under a caller.

Settings managers are pointed at a COPY of `Vribbels/settings/`. Building
a tab is not reliably read-only, and the maintainer's own state is not
something a check may write through.

Skips itself where Tk cannot open a display.

It also guards the `winfo_id()` call in `make_checkbox`, which reads as
dead code -- its return value is discarded -- and is the only thing
stopping a gridful of checkboxes flashing light grey the first time
their tab is shown. Nothing about losing it is visible from a headless
run, so the guard is on the source rather than on behaviour.

And it guards the other piece of `ui/utils/` that looks like reflection
waiting to be deleted: the loop copying a wrapper frame's geometry
methods onto the Text `make_scrolled_text` returns. Without it a
caller's `.pack()` packs the bare Text and the scrollbar is never
placed.
